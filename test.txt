Based on the information you've provided, it is **highly unlikely that 9 people are enough**, especially during the peak parallel phases in late 2025. The core issue is the significant overlap of multiple "Lots" of applications, creating a massive spike in workload that your current team size cannot sustain.

To justify your need for more people, you must move from a gut feeling to a data-driven model. Here is a step-by-step framework to estimate your team's required size.

***

## A 4-Step Framework for Your Headcount Estimation

This approach will help you create a concrete, defensible model to present to the program leadership (SG Paris).

### Step 1: Define Your Work and Estimate Effort per Application

First, you need to break down the work your MGF team does for a single application and estimate the time it takes. Not all applications are the same, so use a "T-shirt sizing" method: **Small, Medium, and Large**.

Categorize apps based on complexity factors:
* Number of jobs (e.g., <5 = Small, 5-15 = Medium, >15 = Large)
* Number of source/target tables
* Complexity of business logic and transformations

Now, create an estimation matrix. Fill this with realistic average hours your team would spend on each task. Below are placeholders; you **must** refine these with your team's input.

| MGF Task | Small App (Hours) | Medium App (Hours) | Large App (Hours) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SIT Support** | | | |
| Setup & KT Review | 4 | 8 | 16 |
| Issue Triage & Mgmt (per cycle) | 8 | 20 | 40 |
| **UAT Execution** | | | |
| Test Prep & Data Staging | 8 | 16 | 24 |
| Test Execution (per cycle) | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| **Post-Testing** | | | |
| Parallel Run Support | 8 | 16 | 32 |
| Production Switch Support | 4 | 8 | 12 |
| **Total Estimated Hours per App** | **42** | **93** | **174** |

**Assumption:** The estimates above assume one or two test cycles. If an application is complex and requires many rounds of fixes and re-testing, these numbers will increase.

### Step 2: Classify All 115 Applications

Go through the list of 115 applications with the Application Teams and classify each one as **Small, Medium, or Large** using your defined criteria. This step is critical for accuracy.

For this exercise, let's make a reasonable assumption:
* **30% Small** (~35 applications)
* **50% Medium** (~57 applications)
* **20% Large** (~23 applications)

### Step 3: Calculate Capacity vs. Demand per Lot

This is where you build your business case. You'll map out the required effort for each Lot against your team's available time.

* **Your Team's Capacity:** 9 people x 8 hours/day = **72 hours/day**.

Let's analyze the timeline, paying close attention to overlaps.



**Analysis of Lots & Timeline**

| Lot(s) | # of Apps | Timeline | Working Days* | **Available MGF Hours** (9 people) | **Estimated Required Hours** (Demand) | **Surplus / Deficit** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lot 1** | 3 | Sep 12 - Sep 19 | 6 | 432 | `~180` (e.g., 2M, 1S) | ✅ **+252** |
| **Lots 2 & 4** | 19 | Sep 22 - Nov 24 | 45 | 3,240 | `~1,900` (e.g., 6S, 9M, 4L) | ✅ **+1,340** |
| **Lots 3, 5, 6** | 32 | Nov 25 - Dec 24 | 21 | 1,512 | `~3,100` (e.g., 10S, 16M, 6L) | ❌ **-1,588** |
| **Lot 7** | 15 | Dec 26 - Feb 9 | 32 | 2,304 | `~1,450` (e.g., 4S, 8M, 3L) | ✅ **+854** |
| **Lot 8** | 16 | Feb 10 - Mar 30 | 35 | 2,520 | `~1,550` (e.g., 5S, 8M, 3L) | ✅ **+970** |
| **Lot 9** | 9 | Mar 31 - Apr 20 | 15 | 1,080 | `~850` (e.g., 3S, 4M, 2L) | ✅ **+230** |

_*Working days are approximate (Mon-Fri) and exclude public holidays, which you should factor in for precision._

**The data clearly shows the problem:**
The period from **late November to late December 2025** is a major bottleneck. You have a demand for approximately **3,100 hours** of work but only have **1,512 hours** of capacity. Your team would need to be more than twice its current size to handle this peak load.

### Step 4: Formulate Your Recommendations

With this data, you can go to SG Paris with a clear problem statement and a solution.

1.  **Present the Data:** Show them the capacity vs. demand table. Explain that the current plan is not feasible without causing massive delays, employee burnout, or a severe drop in quality.
2.  **Quantify Your "Ask":**
    * To cover the deficit of ~1,588 hours in the Nov-Dec period, you need additional capacity.
    * **Calculation:** 1588 deficit hours / 21 working days / 8 hours/day ≈ **9.5 people**.
    * **Your Recommendation:** "To meet the aggressive Q4 2025 deadlines for Lots 3, 5, and 6, we need to temporarily or permanently augment the MGF team with an additional **9-10 members**, starting in early November."
3.  **Propose Alternatives (if hiring is not possible):**
    * **De-risk by Rescheduling:** "Can we move the deadline for Lot 3 or Lot 6 into January 2026? This would smooth the workload and allow the existing team to manage the phased delivery."
    * **Reduce Scope:** Ask if any applications in the bottlenecked lots can be deprioritized or simplified.
    * **Improve Efficiency:** While not a complete solution, highlight any steps you are taking to be more efficient, such as creating reusable test scripts, automating parts of the UAT process, or improving the triage workflow with NPW and Snowflake.

By following this estimation model, you are no longer saying "I think I need more people." You are demonstrating *why*, *how many*, and *when* you need them, backed by a clear analysis of the project plan.

## MGF Staffing Estimation Methodology

To estimate if 9 people are enough, you need to convert the defined activities (SIT Assist, UAT, Parallel Run, Production Switch) into a quantifiable **time-per-application** metric and compare it against the total required effort in a given timeframe (Lot duration).

### 1\. Define Effort per Application (App)

First, estimate the average time (in person-days or FTE-days) the MGF team spends on all activities for **one application**. This is the most crucial step.

| **MGF Activity** | **Assumption/Scope** | **Estimated Effort (Days/App)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SIT Assistance** | Assisting NPW (External Vendor) with issue triage, coordination, JIRA updates, re-testing support until "Definition of Done" is met. | $T_{SIT}$ (e.g., 3-5 days) |
| **UAT Execution** | Independent UAT run by MGF, gathering App Team sign-off. | $T_{UAT}$ (e.g., 2-4 days) |
| **Parallel Run Support** | Monitoring/triage for the parallel run phase. | $T_{PR}$ (e.g., 1-2 days) |
| **Production Switch** | Cutover support. | $T_{P S}$ (e.g., 0.5-1 day) |
| **Total MGF Effort per App ($E_{App}$)** | | **$T_{SIT} + T_{UAT} + T_{PR} + T_{PS}$** (e.g., **6.5 - 12 days**) |

*Note: For a more granular estimate, this effort can be broken down by average **Jobs per App** (e.g., an App with 20 jobs takes more effort than one with 5).*

### 2\. Calculate Required Effort per Lot

Use the **Total MGF Effort per App** ($E_{App}$) and the number of applications in each lot ($N_{Lot}$) to find the total effort required per Lot.

$$Total\ Effort_{Lot} = E_{App} \times N_{Lot}$$

### 3\. Calculate Available Capacity per Lot

Determine the available working days for the current 9 MGF FTEs during the Lot's duration ($D_{Lot}$).

$$Available\ Capacity_{Lot} = 9\ FTEs \times D_{Lot}$$
*(Adjust for holidays and planned leave to get actual working days.)*

### 4\. Compare and Determine Need

The key is to compare the **Required Effort** against the **Available Capacity**.

| Lot | Apps ($N_{Lot}$) | Duration ($D_{Lot}$) | Available Capacity (e.g., 9 FTEs x $D_{Lot}$) | Required Effort (e.g., $N_{Lot}$ x $E_{App}$) | **Gap (Need)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lot 1** | 3 | $\approx 20$ days | $\approx 180$ person-days | $3 \times E_{App}$ | Likely **sufficient** |
| **Lot 2** | 14 | $\approx 30$ days | $\approx 270$ person-days | $14 \times E_{App}$ | **Potential Gap** (If $E_{App}$ is high) |
| **Lot 7** | 21 | $\approx 45$ days | $\approx 405$ person-days | $21 \times E_{App}$ | **High Risk** (Likely requires $\uparrow$ FTEs) |

$$\text{Required Additional FTEs} = \frac{(Required\ Effort_{Lot} - Available\ Capacity_{Lot})}{D_{Lot}}$$

### Conclusion on Staffing

Based on the significantly larger Lot sizes and short timelines, particularly for **Lot 2 (14 Apps), Lot 6 (21 Apps), and Lot 7 (21 Apps)**, it is highly probable that **9 people will be insufficient** to run parallel SIT/UAT testing across multiple applications within the target dates. A detailed estimation using the methodology above is mandatory to quantify the exact resource requirement and prevent schedule delays.
